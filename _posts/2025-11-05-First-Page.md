## Hello, World. Welcome to my space.

I’ve been meaning to launch this website for a while a place to document my journey in cybersecurity, offensive security, and CTF competitions. Between labs, research, reports, and late-night debugging sessions, you always think *"I'll do it later"*. Well, **later is now**.

This website will serve as:

- A **journal of my progress** in offensive security  
- A place to **share walkthroughs, tips, methodologies, and writeups**  
- And sometimes, just my **thoughts about hacking, learning, and improvement**  

Think of it as a logbook not of where I am, but where I’m going.

_We break to understand._

## About Me

I'm an offensive security practitioner with a strong interest in:
- Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Research
- Red Teaming & Adversary Simulation
- Capture The Flag challenges and competitions

Member of the **RaBi3a CTF Team**, constantly learning, improving, and competing.

## What You Can Expect Here

I’ll be posting content such as:

- **Pentest / Lab writeups**
- **CTF challenge breakdowns**
- **Security concepts explained simply**
- **Notes & cheat sheets** from real practice
- **Tools and automation scripting**

The goal is **clarity**, not complexity.

## Why This Space Exists

Because growth in cybersecurity is continuous.  
Skills fade fast if they’re not **used** and **reflected on**.

This blog is a reminder to:
> Hack. Learn. Improve. Repeat.

## Final Notes

If you're here because you're learning too -> welcome.  
If you're here because you're curious -> stay.  
If you're here because you want to challenge me —> even better.

Let’s build.  
Let’s break.  
Let’s **evolve.**
