Hey, I'm **F1Z3R** — an offensive security practitioner and CTF competitor.  
I break, analyze, and rebuild systems to understand their weaknesses and how to defend them better.

I focus on **practical offensive security**, real-world attack paths, and continuous skill improvement through labs, projects, and competitions.

Currently part of **RaBi3a CTF Team**, where learning comes through action, challenge, and collaboration.

> **Hack. Learn. Evolve.**  
> We break to understand.
